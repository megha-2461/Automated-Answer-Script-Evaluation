# Automated Answer Script Evaluation System

## 📌 Overview
The Automated Answer Script Evaluation System is a group project aimed at reducing
manual effort in checking answer scripts. The system converts student answer scripts
into digital text and evaluates them automatically by comparing them with model
answers using NLP-based techniques.

This project demonstrates the use of OCR, text preprocessing, and similarity-based
scoring to assign marks in an efficient and transparent manner.
